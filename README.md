- The first 6 digits represent the *date of birth* (YYMMDD).
  - Assumes age is between 16 and 84 years (to determine the correct century).
- Digits 7â€“10 determine *gender*:
  - Numbers >= 5000 = Male
  - Numbers < 5000 = Female
- The last digit is a *checksum* (Luhn algorithm or similar).
- An ID is only stored if it passes all checks.
